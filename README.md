# Clean Code Nodejs starter
A todo API I'm building following Clean Code and SOLID principles on Typescript. Trying to understand how Clean Code and hexagonal architecture work.

## Ressources used

* Dev Mestery clean architecture [Comment api](https://github.com/dev-mastery/comments-api.git)
* BeyondxScratch [Domain Driven Design with Node.js and TypeScript](https://gitlab.com/beyondxscratch/nodejs-with-domain-driven-design)
* Clean Node.js Architecture [khalilstemmler.com](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/enterprise-typescript-nodejs/clean-nodejs-architecture). I strongly recommend to read his series on DDD with Nodejs & Typescript. Trust me you will learn a lot.
